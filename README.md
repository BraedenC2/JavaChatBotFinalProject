# JavaChatBotFinalProject
Java program Chatbot multi-feature
New Proposal Document â€¢ Braeden Connors

Description:

As a person who is extremely interested in Bing AI, ChatGPT, and Google Bard, I want to create my own helpful
Chatbot. The program should provide useful features such as "Conversion", "Notes", "Getting the Time/Date",
"Todo List", "Conversation", and others. The program will contain a single text box GUI, that allows 
the user to enter into a conversation with user-input. Below, the user will have a output box where the
chatbot will communicate and present functions when asked. For example, If the user asks to convert degrees,
the Chatbot will remove its output box, and replace it functions that allow user input to convert C to F, or 
F to C. The user can then ask to speak with the chatbot, which it'll go back to text mode. FileWriters and
FileReaders will be used, since the chatbot will store "memory" and the users notes. 

Base Features:
1) Allows for user-input
2) Conversation (Random, but sensible responses).
3) Notes
4) Todo List
5) Conversion
6) Memory
7) Pleasing visual GUI

*More features may be added or removed or changed*


Stretch Goals:
1) Allows for full conversations (more than basic conversation)
2) Picture & file saving, allowing the chatbot to show pictures that you gave it.
3) Voice audio. Chatbot can speak in English (I never done this before, so I don't know how difficult it 
   will be).
4) Built in games, like TicTacToe
5) Calculator
